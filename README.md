# Memsafe Boii

A simple header only library for handling memory in C/C++, without any possibility of memory leaks.

## Usage

Just 4 simple functions:
- ```c
  void* memsafe_boii_api__allocate(size_t mem_size) // Allocates memory
  ```
- ```c
  void* memsafe_boii_api__reallocate(void* mem_ptr, size_t new_mem_size) // Re-Allocates memory
  ```
- ```c
  void memsafe_boii_api__deallocate(void* mem_ptr) // Deallocates memory
  ```
- ```c
  // Should be called at the end of program
  // Cleans up any un-freed memory
  void memsafe_boii__clean()
  ```

See `test.c` for example usage.

## Testing

#### Compiling with `DEBUG` flag
```shell
gcc memsafe_boii.c test.c -DDEBUG -g -o test
```

#### Running test
```shell
./test

## Memory Leaks check with [Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/)

No leaks were reported by valgrind ðŸ”¥
